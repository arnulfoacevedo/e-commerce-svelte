## Getting Started

In order to run this project you will need to setup **Cloudinary, Stripe, GitHub OAuth, and PlanetScale**.

### Cloudinary

1. Create a Cloudinary account: https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free
2. Create a new Cloudinary project, and add the cloud name to your ```.env```:
```VITE_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your env here"```
3. [Create a new upload preset]("https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_presets#managing_upload_presets_using_the_settings_ui"), and add the preset name to your ```.env```:
```PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET="your env here"```
4. Add your images into your cloudinary account, then insert them into the ```seed.ts``` file where it is marked "TODO CLOUDINARY:"

### PlanetScale

1. Create a PlanetScale account: https://app.planetscale.com
2. Create a new database, then add your DB credentials to the ```.env``` file (you can find the credentials under the "Connect" tab in PlanetScale):
```DATABASE_HOST="your env here"```
```DATABASE_USERNAME="your env here"```
```DATABASE_PASSWORD="your env here"```
3. Get a database connection string (from the same place) and add it to your ```.env``` (it will be under "NodeJS"):
```DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING="mysql://your env here"```
4. Apply the schema to your database with ```pnpm run db:push```
5. Wait to seed the database until your setup stripe

### Stripe

1. Create a Stripe account: https://dashboard.stripe.com/register
2. Get your (TEST) public and secret keys, and add them to the ```.env```:
```PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk_test_..."```
```STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."```
3. Create your products in stripe, then add them to the ```seed.ts``` file where it is marked "TODO STRIPE:" (it is also a good idea to change the products, prices, and images in the ```seed.ts``` file to match your own products)
4. Install the stripe CLI and get webhook signing secret: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli, then add it your your ```.env```:
```STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."```
